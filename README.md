# Modified Morphological Analysis (Sleep Quality)

* **Objective:** construct a two-stage decision-support model to evaluate and rank preventive interventions to improve sleep quality.
* **Method.** Python (NumPy, Pandas) for scoring tables, configuration probabilities, intervention aggregation, and basic checks. 
* **Outcomes.**
The most effective preventive method for preventing sleep disorders is “Medical care”, which involves undergoing regular medical examinations, taking vitamin medications, etc. 
The recommendation “Healthy lifestyle adherence” is also important for preventing sleep problems. It involves a balanced/healthy diet, regular physical exercise, regular walks in the fresh air. 
The main problems affecting sleep are its duration, the level of physical activity and the presence of daytime sleep. 
* **Limitations.** Expert-driven scores and effectiveness judgements are subjective; I note this and check sensitivity by varying the relationship/effectiveness entries and confirming that rankings remain stable.
